Quick pickle the shallot by combining vinegar, half the shallot, sugar, a pinch of salt, and 1 tablespoon of water in a small bowl. Stir and set aside for at least 15 minutes, or until ready to serve.

In a small bowl, blend ground cumin, paprika, coriander, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, salt, and pepper.

Drain and rinse the chickpeas, then pat dry. Season with half the spice blend. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Add the chickpeas and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.

Heat another drizzle of olive oil in the same pan over medium-high heat. Add the jalapeno and the remaining shallot. Season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes.

Add the chickpeas back to the pan. Stir in the tomato paste, concentrated chicken stock, and the remaining spice blend. Cook until the chickpeas are coated in a thick sauce, about 3 minutes.

In a small bowl, mix the sour cream with a squeeze of lime juice. Add salt and pepper to taste, then thin with a bit of water until it reaches drizzling consistency.

Heat tortillas your preferred way–over an open flame, in the microwave, or in a pan. Fill each tortilla with the chickpeas, diced tomato, shredded queso fresco, lime cream, and pickled shallot. Serve with lime wedges on the side.

Enjoy!
