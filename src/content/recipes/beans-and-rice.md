Start cooking the rice - if you don’t have a favorite way to make rice or a rice cooker, here’s what I do - I take 2 cups of water and put it in the microwave to get hot, and while that is heating I add the rice to the pan (with a good lid) and add 1 tablespoon of oil to it and start that heating on medium-high.  The rice shouldn’t really fry but it should absorb the oil a little and get hot.  Usually that takes about the same amount of time it takes to microwave the water (1-2 minutes).   Add the water to the pan (it should steam up really fast) and cover it and lower the heat to low and leave it for 20 minutes or until all the water is absorbed.

Dice the onion and mince the garlic and add them plus the additional oil to a pan big enough to hold all the rest of the ingredients.  Start that sauteing over medium heat until the onions get soft.  Dice the peppers and add them to the pan, continue sauteing until they are soft and the onion has gotten a nice translucent shade of yellow.

Rinse the black beans a little.  They don’t have to be completely washed free of the sauce they come in - some people add the sauce they come in to the dish - but I don’t like that as much so I give them a rinse.  Add them to the pan with ¼ cup of water and then add the rest of the ingredients.   Stir and turn the heat down to low.   Let this all cook together for at least 10 minutes.

To serve - put some rice in a bowl or plate, add the beans on top, and then some toppings that will make it taste even better (up to you):
- Mix ¼ cup red wine vinegar, ¼ cup olive oil, salt and pepper, mix it quickly and then put a little on top of every bowl.
- Sriracha sauce makes everything taste better
- Cheese or sour cream or yogurt go well on top
